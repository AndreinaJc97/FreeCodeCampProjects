            <h2>Time line of the achviements in Grace Murray Hopper's life"</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>1906</strong>  - Born in New York City</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1923</strong>  - She was admitted to Vassar College and graduated <em>Phi Beta Kappa</em> from Vassar in 1928 with a 
                    bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1930</strong>  - Grace Murray married New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper; they they divorced in 1945.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1934</strong>  - Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore. Her dissertation,
                    "New Types of Irreducibility Criteria", was published that same year.
                </li>
                <li>
                        <strong>1943</strong>  - She took a leave of absence from Vassar, where she was an associate professor, and completed sixty days of intensive training at the Midshipmen’s School for Women at Smith College.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1944</strong>  - Hopper graduated first in her class and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior. 
                    <br>There, she joined a team working on the IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, better known as the MARK I, the first electromechanical computer in the United States. 
                    Under the guidance of Howard Aiken, who had developed the MARK I, Hopper and her colleagues worked on top-secret calculations essential to the war effort—computing rocket 
                    trajectories, creating range tables for new anti-aircraft guns, and calibrating minesweepers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1946</strong>  - She continued to work on the MARK II and MARK III computers under Navy contracts. At the end of her three-year term as a research fellow, she left Harvard
                     because there were no permanent positions for women.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1949</strong>  - Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in Philadelphia as a senior mathematician. The company, which was soon acquired by Remington Rand 
                    and then Sperry Rand, had built the first electronic computer (ENIAC) under army contracts.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1950</strong>  - Eckert-Mauchly was developing the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC I), the first commercial electronic computer. While working on the UNIVAC I and II,
                     Hopper pioneered the idea of automatic programming and explored new ways to use the computer to code.</li>
                <li><strong>1952</strong>  - She developed the first compiler called A-0, which translated mathematical code into machine-readable code—an important step toward creating modern programming languages.</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong>  - Hopper proposed the idea of writing programs in words, rather than symbols, but she was told her idea would not work. Nevertheless, she continued working on an English-language compiler.</li>
                <li><strong>1956</strong>  - By this year her team was running FLOW-MATIC, the first programming language to use word commands.</li>
                <li><strong>1959</strong>  - Hopper took part in the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL), the goal of which was to develop a common business language that could be used across industries and sectors.</li>
                <li><strong>1966</strong>  - Age restrictions forced her to retire from the Navy as a commander. She later called it <q>the saddest day of my life.</q> Just months later, however, she was recalled to active service to help standardize the Navy’s multiple computer languages and programs.</li>
                <li><strong>1971</strong>  - She retired once more in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972.</li>
                <li><strong>1972</strong>  - She received Yale’s Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal awarded to outstanding alumni.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong>  - She became the first woman and the first American to become a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society.</li>
                <li><strong>1991</strong>  - President George Bush awarded Hopper the National Medal of Technology <q>for her pioneering accomplishments in the development of computer programming languages that simplified computer technology and opened the door to a significantly larger universe of users</q>;
                     she was the first woman to receive the nation’s highest technology award as an individual.</li>
                <li><strong>1992</strong>  - She died at the age 82 in 1992.</li>
            </ul>

                "The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler," 
                she said, "is training young people.<br>They come to me, you know, and say, 
                'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that.
                <br> I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't 
                forget to take chances".  <br><br><em>--- Grace Murray Hopper</em></blockquote>
